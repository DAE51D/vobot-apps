Can we use the priority png icons for when a new ntfy message comes in instead of the "NEW" text?

**Modifying notification icons**

I need to modify the ntfy app so that it uses priority PNG icons when a new message arrives, rather than displaying the text "NEW." I should open the relevant files to start editing, likely focusing on `ntfy/apps/ntfy/__init__.py`, which should have the UI components. I’ll use `apply_patch` and include inline comments to explain my changes, but I have to remember to keep the debug prints as they are. Let's read through the file!I'll inspect the ntfy app code to locate where "NEW" is shown and wire in priority PNG icons from the resources.
