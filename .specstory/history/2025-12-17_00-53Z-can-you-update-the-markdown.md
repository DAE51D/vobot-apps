Can you update the #file:proxmox.prompt.md and #file:README.md with anything else you might find useful. These were copied and modified from the #file:ntfy.prompt.md and #file:README.md so there may be deprecated or nonrelevant bits still.

**Planning file updates**

I need to update two files:proxmo.prompt.md and proxmox README.md. The user wants me to remove deprecated content and add anything useful. I’ll call the apply_patch tool to edit these files. Additionally, I have to use the manage_todo_list tool for tracking progress. I’ll create a concise plan with steps like updating proxmox.prompt.md to remove outdated information and adjusting its content, followed by similar updates to proxmox README.md. I'll keep the preamble brief before proceeding with the tool calls.**Preparing for file updates**

I need to preface each batch of tool calls with a brief preamble to explain the purpose of the updates. First, I’ll call manage_todo_list to write the plan, then apply_patch to update proxmox.prompt.md, followed by updating proxmox README.md. After those edits, I'll summarize the changes and ask the user about any further edits. I'll ensure to present changes concisely and use the proper file links while avoiding mentions of the model name. Let's prepare the updated content for proxmox.prompt.md now.**Updating Proxmox files**

I need to update the subscription specifics and Proxmox API details that are already in proxmox.prompt.md. I’ll remove any JSONL and ntfy examples that might have been left in by mistake. Even though proxmox.prompt.md is mostly tailored for Proxmox now, I suspect there are leftover references to messages. I’ll refocus the content on Proxmox metrics, API endpoints, token usage, and settings. I also need to update proxmox README.md to remove ntfy remnants and tailor the app overview, features, and installation instructions specifically for Proxmox. Let’s prepare the patches and reference the right file paths.**Drafting Proxmox updates**

I've got the repo paths for the updates: .github/prompts/proxmox.prompt.md and proxmox/README.md. I’ll use apply_patch to make updates to both. For the prompt file, I'll retain the front matter, tools, and descriptions, then focus on details like Proxmox server specifics and objectives for building an app metrics viewer to display LXC/VM counts and graphs. I'll also define functional requirements, implement a testing plan, and update the README with Proxmox-specific features and installation commands. Finally, I’ll run manage_todo_list to write steps and mark them as in-progress.**Planning multi-step updates**

I need to start by using the tool to plan and track the multi-step task. I'll create a plan with three steps: 1. Update the prompt file, 2. Update the README, and 3. Review changes. For now, step 1 will be marked as in-progress since I've yet to apply patches. It seems I'll need to call manage_todo_list before and after the patches to keep everything updated. I'll include preambles before each tool call to maintain clarity. Let’s carefully craft the patch contents and get started!I'll create a short todo plan, then update the `proxmox.prompt.md` and `README.md` to remove ntfy-specific bits and make them Proxmox-focused.
