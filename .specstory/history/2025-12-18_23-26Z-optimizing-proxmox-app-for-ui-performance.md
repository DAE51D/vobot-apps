# Optimizing Proxmox app for UI performance (2025-12-18 23:26Z)

_**User (2025-12-18 23:37Z)**_

Please examine this proxmox app's python code and optimize for speed, size, efficiency, security, etc. Ensure we're not making excessive API calls or returning more information than we actually need.

Something that has been very slow is the wheel dial between the default graphic UI page 1 and the debug page 2. What can we do to speed this transition up as it shouldn't take so long especially going from a LVGL graphic render page to a basic text one.
